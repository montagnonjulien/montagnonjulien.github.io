        <p>
            Born in France in 1980, I studied Medical and Social sciences in high school and I've been graduated in 2000. Then I went to the nurse school in Grenoble where I got graduated as nurse auxiliary in 2003.<br> At this point I decided to reach the capital to develop my artistic side. I did a 2 years theater class in Paris and worked on different project for the theater and the TV. After 5 years in Paris it was time to move on, I decided to move to Berlin to start a new life.<br>Since I'm in Berlin I had several experiences in customer support but I also developed other professional facets as a masseur, during a trip in Thailand, but also as a silkscreen printer.<br>In 2019, I started a new training at the Digital Career Institute.
